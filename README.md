Simple iOS app to demonstrate parsing of JSON using the Codable protocol

This was a quick app I made to practice parsing JSON using Swift 4 with native libraries. This uses the new Codable protocols for easier JSON parsing.

The app displays a table of NYC schools using the NYC OpenData API and it displays a school's SAT scores.
